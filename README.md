# Programming Assignment: High-Low-game

This is a bash script that will play High-Low against the user with the following details:

_ The program begins by asking the user to think of a number (1-100), and having them hit any key when they've got a number in mind. 
It then immediately begins playing the game by making its first guess.

_ If the user hits anything other than h, l or c, it will print a message reminding the user which keys they can use.

_ User doesn't require to hit ENTER after typing h l or c, the script will be looking for a single keystroke and then continue

_ Program will run and detect cheating. For example, if 51 is high and 50 is low, the user must be cheating, the program will inform the user, and exit the game.
